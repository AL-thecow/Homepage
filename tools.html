            <p>Windscribe is similar to tor, however, it faster, but less secure. The main drawback is that the free version limits you with a 10gb a month limit.</p>

            <p>Firefox is a beautiful, clean, browser that respects your privacy. Unlike other browsers, which are all based on chrome, firefox is built from the ground up, and asks for permission to use your data, and lets you stop them from using your browsing data at any time.</p>
            <p>Follow the instructions on Mozilla's website to start using Firefox</p>

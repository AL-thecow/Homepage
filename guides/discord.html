            <h3>Why Use Discord</h3>
            <p>Our Discord Server is our longest standing chat platform out of our 3 chat servers. It has the most people and is connected to both our Matrix and Revolt Servers via a bridge!</p>
            <p>Discord is Free! While it does some customization features behind a paywall, they aren't needed, it's just a matter of personal preference.</p>
            <p>The Only Downside is that Discord is blocked on the school's internet, meaning that you won't be able to use it.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <h3>Make an Account</h3>
            <p>The first thing you're going to need is a Discord account, so head to <a href="https://discord.com">Discord's Website</a> to make one! It will ask for your email, and then a username and Password for your account.</p>
            <h3>Choose a Platorm</h3>
            <p>Discord is available everywhere. It has a client for desktops, mobile and on the web, and all are more are less the same, but the desktop versions generally have more features.</p>
            <p>For first time user's, the web version is enough for a desktop, so verify your email with discord and login using discords website, and later you can look at getting the desktop version</p>
            <h3>Join and Verify</h3>
            <p>Once your account is set up, click the <a href="#">link here</a> to join our server. Once your on, you'll need to use our verifier to confirm that you're an OCDSB student. (Currently, the Verifier is not complete, so the verification process must be done manually)</p>
            <h3>Finishing up</h3>
            <p>You're Done! Now you can chat with your friends and other students of Colonel By!</p>
            <p>You can also change your profile picture and set a custom status</p>

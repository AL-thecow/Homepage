            <h3>Why Use Revolt</h3>
            <p>Revolt is a lot like discord, in looks and in features. However, Revolt allows for more customization by the user, and nothing is locked behind a paywall.</p>
            <p>Another bonus of Revolt is that it isn't blocked on the school's wifi, meaning that you could still message your friends when needed at school.</p>
            <p>Revolt is also bridged to a few channels of our discord server. So you'll still be connected with those not on our Revolt server!</p>

            <h3>Why Use Matrix</h3>
            <p>Matrix is prvacy focused and usable across many different clients, and is connected to our discord server</p>
            <p>Matrix has a lot of options for clients and there is no right "one" to use.</p>
            <p>For this guide, we recommend using Element, a simple and easy to use client.</p>
            <p>Like Revolt, Matrix is also not blocked on the School Board's Wifi, meaning you can still contact and chat with your friends without and problems</p>
